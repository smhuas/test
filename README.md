# how to delete a commit

just go to a commit below the commit you want to delete
    ex :- git reset HEAD~1

then push the changes to the branch forcefully
    ex :- git push origin branch -f

it can be done in vscode(git graph) also.
go to the commit below the commit you want to delete
    ex :- right click on the commit and use option "Reset current branch to this commit"

then push the changes to the branch forcefully
    ex :- right click on the branch and select push, in the options you can find "force"
